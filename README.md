Several pieces in this repo

1. A column inference Spark Job that performs basically statistical analysis on columns
to extract basic understanding of a particular dataset
2. Backend for an integrated data science environment where user can run R/Python/SQL in a single
environment on their dataset. Frontend repo is at https://github.com/yanji84/InteractiveEnvironment
3. An automatic ML environment where based on the analysis done on #1, self-generated
machine learning code for model automation

For #3, refer to architecture.png for overall architecture diagram
