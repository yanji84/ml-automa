I have included several side project work in this repo

1. A column inference Spark Job that performs statistical analysis on columns
to extract basic understanding of a particular dataset & automatic relationship discovery
among different data sets
2. Backend for an integrated data science environment where user can run R/Python/SQL in a single
environment on their dataset. Frontend repo is at https://github.com/yanji84/InteractiveEnvironment
3. An automatic ML environment where based on the analysis done on #1, self-generated
machine learning code for model automation. Overall architecture diagram https://github.com/yanji84/projectx/blob/master/architecture.png. Design doc is available https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w5OPXpd3Ayi79Ka3pTsQw6iJNfl55hE-KLp06xVxsF4/edit?usp=sharing
